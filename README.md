# Floyd Warshall Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Floyd's algorithm rewritten to use recursion. It includes unit tests for each function and performance tests to compare this recursive version against the imperative version.

## PEP Standards Compliance

The code adheres to the guidelines outlined in the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), ensuring readability and maintainability.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests have been implemented for each function in the algorithm to ensure correctness and robustness. These tests validate the behavior of the recursive implementation against expected outcomes.

## Performance Tests

Performance tests have been conducted to compare the runtime of the recursive function with the imperative function. By measuring runtime of these functionsI was able to compare the results in microseconds to accept my Null Hypothesis.

## Documentation

The documentation provided outlines the approach and methodology used in rewriting Floyd's algorithm recursively. It references research on null hypothesis, unit testing, and performance testing.

### Null Hypothesis

There is no difference between the Imperative Function and the Recursive Func-tion.
