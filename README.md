# Floyd_Warshall_Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of Floyd's algorithm rewritten to use recursion. It includes unit tests for each function and performance tests to compare this recursive version against the imperative version.

## PEP Standards Compliance

The code adheres to the guidelines outlined in the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), ensuring readability and maintainability.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests have been implemented for each function in the algorithm to ensure correctness and robustness. These tests validate the behavior of the recursive implementation against expected outcomes.

## Performance Tests

Performance tests have been conducted to compare the efficiency of the recursive version with the imperative version. By measuring Time Complexity, Memory Consumption, and Empirical Tests comparing the differences in performance between the two approaches.

## Documentation

The documentation provided outlines the approach and methodology used in rewriting Floyd's algorithm recursively. It references research on null hypothesis, unit testing, and performance testing.

### Null Hypothesis

The null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference between the recursive algorithm and the imperative algorithm. This hypothesis will be tested and evaluated through empirical data gathered from performance testing.

All source code provided publically along with supporting documentation.
